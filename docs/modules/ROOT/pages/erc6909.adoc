== Extensions

Additionally, there are multiple custom extensions, including:

* xref:erc6909-supply.adoc[ERC-6909 Supply]: Extension of the ERC-6909 standard that adds tracking of total supply per token id.

* ERC-6909 Metadata: Optional extension that adds token metadata support.

* ERC-6909 ContentURI: Optional extension that adds a contract URI support.

Currently, only the Supply extension has been fully implemented, Metadata and ContentUri have been designed, and will be implemented soon.
